# Beets Tutorial for Beginners
Hello and welcome to the Beets Tutorial for Beginners. If you have limited experience coding in Python and have never used Beets, you've 
come to the right place. This tutorial will walk you through all the steps necessary to set up Beets and use it to accomplish a simple task.

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this tutorial successfully, there are a few things that you should already have installed:

## 1. You will need Python. Beets works on Python 3.6 or later.
### macOS 
macOS 11 (Big Sur) includes Python 3.8 out of the box. You can opt for a more recent Python installing it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (` brew install python3 `)
. Thereâ€™s also a [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) port. Run ` port install beets ` or ` port install beets-full ` to include many third-party plugins.

### Debian or Ubuntu
On Debian or Ubuntu, depending on the version, beets is available as an official package ([Debian details](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/beets), [Ubuntu details](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/beets)), so try typing: ` apt-get install beets `. But the version in the repositories might lag behind, so make sure you read the right version of these docs. If you want the latest version, you can get everything you need to install with pip as described below by running: ` apt-get install python-dev python-pip `

### Arch Linux

### Gentoo Linux

### FreeBSD
