class ImportState:
    """Representing the progress of an import task.

    Opens the state file on creation of the class. If you want
    to ensure the state is written to disk, you should use the
    context manager protocol.

    Tagprogress allows long tagging tasks to be resumed when they pause.

    Taghistory is a utility for manipulating the "incremental" import log.
    This keeps track of all directories that were ever imported, which
    allows the importer to only import new stuff.

    Usage
    -----
    ```
    # Readonly
    progress = ImportState().tagprogress

    # Read and write
    with ImportState() as state:
        state["key"] = "value"
    ```
