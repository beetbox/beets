"""A metaclass for enumerated types that really are types.

You can create enumerations with `enum(values, [name])` and they work
how you would expect them to.

    >>> from enumeration import enum
    >>> Direction = enum('north east south west', name='Direction')
    >>> Direction.west
    Direction.west
    >>> Direction.west == Direction.west
    True
    >>> Direction.west == Direction.east
    False
    >>> isinstance(Direction.west, Direction)
    True
    >>> Direction[3]
    Direction.west
    >>> Direction['west']
    Direction.west
    >>> Direction.west.name
    'west'
    >>> Direction.north < Direction.west
    True

Enumerations are classes; their instances represent the possible values
of the enumeration. Because Python classes must have names, you may
provide a `name` parameter to `enum`; if you don't, a meaningless one
will be chosen for you.

    is created, it is instantiated for each name value in `values`.
