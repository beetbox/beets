"""Simple but robust implementation of generator/coroutine-based
pipelines in Python. The pipelines may be run either sequentially
(single-threaded) or in parallel (one thread per pipeline stage).

This implementation supports pipeline bubbles (indications that the
processing for a certain item should abort). To use them, yield the
BUBBLE constant from any stage coroutine except the last.

In the parallel case, the implementation transparently handles thread
shutdown when the processing is complete and when a stage raises an
exception. KeyboardInterrupts (^C) are also handled.

When running a parallel pipeline, it is also possible to use
multiple coroutines for the same pipeline stage; this lets you speed
up a bottleneck stage by dividing its work among multiple threads.
To do so, pass an iterable of coroutines to the Pipeline constructor
in place of any single coroutine.
