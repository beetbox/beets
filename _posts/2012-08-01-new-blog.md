Welcome to the brand new [beets blog][]! The beets project has had [a Twitter account][b33ts] for some time now, but I increasingly have more to say than will fit in 140 characters. This blog will be a venue for more detailed writing about the project, Python, open source development, and music software.

These are some of the posts you can expect as the blog gets rolling:

* In-depth descriptions of new features and design changes in beets.
* Guides to doing cool, non-obvious stuff with beets.
* My plans and proposals for how beets will evolve.
* Useful Python snippets and libraries that grow out of the beets project (like [Bluelet][], [Confit][], [pyacoustid][], and [audioread][]).
* Opinions on Python development and maintaining open source projects.
