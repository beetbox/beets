"""Adds head/tail functionality to list/ls.

1. Implemented as `lslimit` command with `--head` and `--tail` options. This is
   the idiomatic way to use this plugin.
2. Implemented as query prefix `<` for head functionality only. This is the
   composable way to use the plugin (plays nicely with anything that uses the
   query language).
