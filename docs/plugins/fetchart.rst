FetchArt Plugin
===============

The ``fetchart`` plugin retrieves album art images from various sources on the
Web and stores them as image files.


Fetching Album Art During Import
--------------------------------

To automatically get album art for every album you import, just enable the
plugin by putting ``fetchart`` on your config file's ``plugins`` line (see
:doc:`/plugins/index`).

By default, beets stores album art image files alongside the music files for an
album in a file called ``cover.jpg``. To customize the name of this file, use
the :ref:`art-filename` config option.

A maximum image width can be defined to downscale fetched images if they are too
big. The resize operation reduces image width to ``maxwidth`` pixels and 
height is recomputed so that aspect ratio is preserved.  
When using ``maxwidth`` config option, please consider installing 
[ImageMagick](www.imagemagick.org/) first for optimal performance. 

To disable automatic art downloading, just put this in your configuration
file::

    [fetchart]
    autofetch: no

Manually Fetching Album Art
---------------------------

Use the ``fetchart`` command to download album art after albums have already
been imported::

    $ beet fetchart [-f] [query]

By default, the command will only look for album art when the album doesn't
already have it; the ``-f`` or ``--force`` switch makes it search for art
regardless. If you specify a query, only matching albums will be processed;
otherwise, the command processes every album in your library.

Album Art Sources
-----------------

Currently, this plugin searches for art in the local filesystem as well as on
the Cover Art Archive, Amazon, and AlbumArt.org (in that order).

When looking for local album art, beets checks for image files located in the
same folder as the music files you're importing. If you have an image file
called "cover," "front," "art," "album," for "folder" alongside your music,
beets will treat it as album art and skip searching any online databases.

When you choose to apply changes during an import, beets searches all sources
for album art. For "as-is" imports (and non-autotagged imports using the ``-A``
flag), beets only looks for art on the local filesystem.

Embedding Album Art
-------------------

This plugin fetches album art but does not embed images into files' tags. To do
that, use the :doc:`/plugins/embedart`. (You'll want to have both plugins
enabled.)
