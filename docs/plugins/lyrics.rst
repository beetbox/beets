Lyrics Plugin
=============

The ``lyrics`` plugin fetches and stores song lyrics from databases on the Web.
Namely, the current version of the plugin uses `Musixmatch`_, `Genius.com`_,
and, optionally, the Google custom search API.

.. _Musixmatch: https://www.musixmatch.com/
.. _Genius.com: https://genius.com/


Fetch Lyrics During Import
--------------------------

To automatically fetch lyrics for songs you import, enable the ``lyrics``
plugin in your configuration (see :ref:`using-plugins`).
Then, install the `requests`_ library by typing::

    pip install requests

The plugin uses `requests`_ to download lyrics.

When importing new files, beets will now fetch lyrics for files that don't
already have them. The lyrics will be stored in the beets database. If the
``import.write`` config option is on, then the lyrics will also be written to
the files' tags.

.. _requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/


Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, make a ``lyrics:`` section in your
configuration file. The available options are:

- **auto**: Fetch lyrics automatically during import.
  Default: ``yes``.
- **bing_client_secret**: Your Bing Translation application password
  (to :ref:`lyrics-translation`)
- **bing_lang_from**: By default all lyrics with a language other than
  ``bing_lang_to`` are translated. Use a list of lang codes to restrict the set
  of source languages to translate.
  Default: ``[]``
- **bing_lang_to**: Language to translate lyrics into.
  Default: None.
- **fallback**: By default, the file will be left unchanged when no lyrics are
  found. Use the empty string ``''`` to reset the lyrics in such a case.
  Default: None.
- **force**: By default, beets won't fetch lyrics if the files already have
  ones. To instead always fetch lyrics, set the ``force`` option to ``yes``.
  Default: ``no``.
- **google_API_key**: Your Google API key (to enable the Google Custom Search
  backend).
  Default: None.
- **google_engine_ID**: The custom search engine to use.
  Default: The `beets custom search engine`_, which gathers an updated list of
  sources known to be scrapeable.
- **sources**: List of sources to search for lyrics. An asterisk ``*`` expands
  to all available sources.
  Default: ``google lyricwiki musixmatch genius``, i.e., all the
  available sources. The ``google`` source will be automatically
  deactivated if no ``google_API_key`` is setup.
  Both it and the ``genius`` source will only be enabled if BeautifulSoup is
  installed.

Here's an example of ``config.yaml``::

    lyrics:
      fallback: ''
      google_API_key: AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWXCVBN1234567890_ab
      google_engine_ID: 009217259823014548361:lndtuqkycfu

Fetching Lyrics Manually
------------------------

The ``lyrics`` command provided by this plugin fetches lyrics for items that
match a query (see :doc:`/reference/query`). For example, ``beet lyrics magnetic
fields absolutely cuckoo`` will get the lyrics for the appropriate Magnetic
Fields song, ``beet lyrics magnetic fields`` will get lyrics for all my tracks
by that band, and ``beet lyrics`` will get lyrics for my entire library. The
lyrics will be added to the beets database and, if ``import.write`` is on,
embedded into files' metadata.

The ``-p`` option to the ``lyrics`` command makes it print lyrics out to the
console so you can view the fetched (or previously-stored) lyrics.

The ``-f`` option forces the command to fetch lyrics, even for tracks that
already have lyrics. Inversely, the ``-l`` option restricts operations
to lyrics that are locally available, which show lyrics faster without using
the network at all.

Rendering Lyrics into Other Formats
-----------------------------------

The ``-r directory`` option renders all lyrics as `reStructuredText`_ (ReST)
documents in ``directory`` (by default, the current directory). That
directory, in turn, can be parsed by tools like `Sphinx`_ to generate HTML,
ePUB, or PDF documents.

A minimal ``conf.py`` and ``index.rst`` files are created the first time the
command is run. They are not overwritten on subsequent runs, so you can safely
modify these files to customize the output.

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/
.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Sphinx supports various `builders
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/builders.html>`_, but here are a
few suggestions.

 * Build an HTML version::

    sphinx-build -b html . _build/html

 * Build an ePUB3 formatted file, usable on ebook readers::

    sphinx-build -b epub3 . _build/epub

 * Build a PDF file, which incidentally also builds a LaTeX file::

    sphinx-build -b latex %s _build/latex && make -C _build/latex all-pdf

.. _activate-google-custom-search:

Activate Google Custom Search
------------------------------

Using the Google backend requires `BeautifulSoup`_, which you can install
using `pip`_ by typing::

    pip install beautifulsoup4

You also need to `register for a Google API key`_. Set the ``google_API_key``
configuration option to your key.
Then add ``google`` to the list of sources in your configuration (or use
default list, which includes it as long as you have an API key).
If you use default ``google_engine_ID``, we recommend limiting the sources to
``musixmatch google`` as the other sources are already included in the Google
results.

.. _register for a Google API key: https://console.developers.google.com/

Optionally, you can `define a custom search engine`_. Get your search engine's
token and use it for your ``google_engine_ID`` configuration option. By
default, beets use a list of sources known to be scrapeable.

.. _define a custom search engine: https://www.google.com/cse/all

Note that the Google custom search API is limited to 100 queries per day.
After that, the lyrics plugin will fall back on other declared data sources.

Activate Genius Lyrics
----------------------

Like the Google backend, the Genius backend requires the `BeautifulSoup`_
library. Install it by typing::

    pip install beautifulsoup4

The backend is enabled by default.

.. _lyrics-translation:

Activate On-the-Fly Translation
-------------------------------

Using the Bing Translation API requires `langdetect`_, which you can install
using `pip`_ by typing::

    pip install langdetect

You also need to register for a Microsoft Azure Marketplace free account and
to the `Microsoft Translator API`_. Follow the four steps process, specifically
at step 3 enter ``beets`` as *Client ID* and copy/paste the generated
*Client secret* into your ``bing_client_secret`` configuration, alongside
``bing_lang_to`` target `language code`.
