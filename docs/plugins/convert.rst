Convert Plugin
==============

The ``convert`` plugin lets you convert parts of your collection to a
directory of your choice, transcoding audio and embedding album art along the
way. It can transcode to and from any format using a configurable command
line.


Installation
------------

To use the ``convert`` plugin, first enable it in your configuration (see
:ref:`using-plugins`). By default, the plugin depends on `FFmpeg`_ to
transcode the audio, so you might want to install it.

.. _FFmpeg: http://ffmpeg.org


Usage
-----

To convert a part of your collection, run ``beet convert QUERY``. The
command will transcode all the files matching the query to the
destination directory given by the ``-d`` (``--dest``) option or the
``dest`` configuration. The path layout mirrors that of your library,
but it may be customized through the ``paths`` configuration.

The plugin uses a command-line program to transcode the audio. With the
``-f`` (``--format``) option you can choose the transcoding command
and customize the available commands
:ref:`through the configuration <convert-format-config>`.

Unless the ``-y`` (``--yes``) flag is set, the command will list all
the items to be converted and ask for your confirmation.

The ``-a`` (or ``--album``) option causes the command
to match albums instead of tracks.

By default, the command places converted files into the destination directory
and leaves your library pristine. To instead back up your original files into
the destination directory and keep converted files in your library, use the
``-k`` (or ``--keep-new``) option.

To test your configuration without taking any actions, use the ``--pretend``
flag. The plugin will print out the commands it will run instead of executing
them.


Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, make a ``convert:`` section in your configuration
file. The available options are:

- **auto**: Import transcoded versions of your files automatically during
  imports. With this option enabled, the importer will transcode all (in the
  default configuration) non-MP3 files over the maximum bitrate before adding
  them to your library.
  Default: ``no``.
- **tmpdir**: The directory where temporary files will be stored during import.
  Default: none (system default),
- **copy_album_art**: Copy album art when copying or transcoding albums matched
  using the ``-a`` option. Default: ``no``.
- **album_art_maxwidth**: Downscale album art if it's too big. The resize
  operation reduces image width to at most ``maxwidth`` pixels while
  preserving the aspect ratio.
- **dest**: The directory where the files will be converted (or copied) to.
  Default: none.
- **embed**: Embed album art in converted items. Default: ``yes``.
- **id3v23**: Can be used to override the global ``id3v23`` option. Default:
  ``inherit``.
- **max_bitrate**: All lossy files with a higher bitrate will be
  transcoded and those with a lower bitrate will simply be copied. Note that
  this does not guarantee that all converted files will have a lower
  bitrate---that depends on the encoder and its configuration.
  Default: none.
- **no_convert**: Does not transcode items matching provided query string
  (see :doc:`/reference/query`). (i.e. ``format:AAC, format:WMA`` or
  ``path::\.(m4a|wma)$``)
- **never_convert_lossy_files**: Cross-conversions between lossy codecs---such
  as mp3, ogg vorbis, etc.---makes little sense as they will decrease quality
  even further. If set to ``yes``, lossy files are always copied.
  Default: ``no``.
- **paths**: The directory structure and naming scheme for the converted
  files. Uses the same format as the top-level ``paths`` section (see
  :ref:`path-format-config`).
  Default: Reuse your top-level path format settings.
- **quiet**: Prevent the plugin from announcing every file it processes.
  Default: ``false``.
- **threads**: The number of threads to use for parallel encoding.
  By default, the plugin will detect the number of processors available and use
  them all.

You can also configure the format to use for transcoding (see the next
section):

- **format**: The name of the format to transcode to when none is specified on
  the command line.
  Default: ``mp3``.
- **formats**: A set of formats and associated command lines for transcoding
  each.

Configuring the transcoding command
```````````````````````````````````

You can customize the transcoding command through the ``formats`` map
and select a command with the ``--format`` command-line option or the
``format`` configuration.

::

    convert:
        format: speex
        formats:
            speex:
                command: ffmpeg -i $source -y -acodec speex $dest
                extension: spx
            wav: ffmpeg -i $source -y -acodec pcm_s16le $dest

In this example ``beet convert`` will use the *speex* command by
default. To convert the audio to `wav`, run ``beet convert -f wav``.
This will also use the format key (``wav``) as the file extension.

Each entry in the ``formats`` map consists of a key (the name of the
format) as well as the command and optionally the file extension.
``extension`` is the filename extension to be used for newly transcoded
files.  If only the command is given as a string or the extension is not
provided, the file extension defaults to the format's name. ``command`` is the
command to use to transcode audio. The tokens ``$source`` and ``$dest`` in the
command are replaced with the paths to the existing and new file.

The plugin in comes with default commands for the most common audio
formats: `mp3`, `alac`, `flac`, `aac`, `opus`, `ogg`, `wmv`. For
details have a look at the output of ``beet config -d``.

For a one-command-fits-all solution use the ``convert.command`` and
``convert.extension`` options. If these are set, the formats are ignored
and the given command is used for all conversions.

    convert:
        command: ffmpeg -i $source -y -vn -aq 2 $dest
        extension: mp3


Gapless MP3 encoding
````````````````````

While FFmpeg cannot produce "`gapless`_" MP3s by itself, you can create them
by using `LAME`_ directly. Use a shell script like this to pipe the output of
FFmpeg into the LAME tool::

    #!/bin/sh
    ffmpeg -i "$1" -f wav - | lame -V 2 --noreplaygain - "$2"

Then configure the ``convert`` plugin to use the script::

    convert:
        command: /path/to/script.sh $source $dest
        extension: mp3

This strategy configures FFmpeg to produce a WAV file with an accurate length
header for LAME to use. Using ``--noreplaygain`` disables gain analysis; you
can use the :doc:`/plugins/replaygain` to do this analysis. See the LAME
`documentation`_ and the `HydrogenAudio wiki`_ for other LAME configuration
options and a thorough discussion of MP3 encoding.
