Missing Plugin
==============

This plugin adds a new command, ``missing`` or ``miss``, which finds and lists
missing tracks for albums in your collection. Each album requires one network
call to album data source.

Usage
-----

Add the ``missing`` plugin to your configuration (see :ref:`using-plugins`). By
default, the ``beet missing`` command fetches album information from the origin
data source and lists names of the **tracks** that are missing from your
library. It can also list the names of albums that
your library is missing from each artist.
You can customize the output format, count
the number of missing tracks per album, or total up the number of missing
tracks over your whole library, using command-line switches::

      -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                            print with custom FORMAT
      -c, --count           count missing tracks per album
      -t, --total           count total of missing tracks or albums
      -a, --album           show missing albums for artist instead of tracks

…or by editing corresponding options.

Note that ``-c`` is ignored when used with ``-a``.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, make a ``missing:`` section in your
configuration file. The available options are:

- **count**: Print a count of missing tracks per album, with ``format``
  defaulting to ``$albumartist - $album: $missing``.
  Default: ``no``.
- **format**: A specific format with which to print every
  track. This uses the same template syntax as beets'
  :doc:`path formats </reference/pathformat>`. The usage is inspired by, and
  therefore similar to, the :ref:`list <list-cmd>` command.
  Default: :ref:`format_item`.
- **total**: Print a single count of missing tracks in all albums.
  Default: ``no``.

Here's an example ::

    missing:
        format: $albumartist - $album - $title
        count: no
        total: no

Template Fields
---------------

With this plugin enabled, the ``$missing`` template field expands to the
number of tracks missing from each album.
