Missing Plugin
==============

This plugin adds a new command, ``missing`` or ``miss``, which finds
and lists, for every album in your collection, which or how many
tracks are missing. Listing missing files requires one network call to
MusicBrainz. Merely counting missing files avoids any network calls.


Installation
------------

Enable the plugin by putting ``missing`` on your ``plugins`` line in
:doc:`config file </reference/config>`::

    plugins:
        missing
        ...

Configuration
-------------

By default, the ``beet missing`` command lists the names of tracks that your
library is missing from each album. You can customize the output format, count
the number of missing tracks per album, or total up the number of missing
tracks over your whole library. These options can either be specified in the
config file::

    missing:
        format: $albumartist - $album - $title
        count: no
        total: no

or on the command-line::

      -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                            print with custom FORMAT
      -c, --count           count missing tracks per album
      -t, --total           count total of missing tracks


format
~~~~~~

The ``format`` option (default: :ref:`list_format_item`) lets you specify a
specific format with which to print every track. This uses the same template
syntax as beets’ :doc:`path formats </reference/pathformat>`.  The usage is
inspired by, and therefore similar to, the :ref:`list <list-cmd>` command.

count
~~~~~

The ``count`` option (default: false) prints a count of missing tracks
per album, with ``format`` defaulting to ``$albumartist - $album:
$missing``.

total
~~~~~

The ``total`` option (default: false) prints a single
count of missing tracks in all albums

Metadata fields
---------------

With this plugin enabled, templates can reference ``$missing`` as they
can any standard metadata field for use in :doc:`Queries
</reference/query>` and :doc:`Path Formats </reference/pathformat>`.

Examples
--------

List all missing tracks in your collection::

  beet missing

List all missing tracks from 2008::

  beet missing year:2008

Print out a unicode histogram of the missing track years using `spark`_::

  beet missing -f '$year' | spark
  ▆▁▆█▄▇▇▄▇▇▁█▇▆▇▂▄█▁██▂█▁▁██▁█▂▇▆▂▇█▇▇█▆▆▇█▇█▇▆██▂▇

Print out a listing of all albums with missing tracks, and respective counts::

  beet missing -c

Print out a count of the total number of missing tracks::

  beet missing -t

Call this plugin from other beet commands::

  beet ls -a -f '$albumartist - $album: $missing'
