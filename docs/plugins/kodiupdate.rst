KodiUpdate Plugin
=================

The ``kodiupdate`` plugin lets you automatically update `Kodi`_'s music
library whenever you change your beets library.

To use ``kodiupdate`` plugin, enable it in your configuration
(see :ref:`using-plugins`).
Then, you'll want to configure the specifics of your Kodi host.
You can do that using a ``kodi:`` section in your ``config.yaml``,
which looks like this::

    kodi:
        host: localhost
        port: 8080
        user: kodi
        pwd: kodi

To use the ``kodiupdate`` plugin you need to install the `requests`_ library with::

    pip install requests

You'll also need to enable JSON-RPC in Kodi in order the use the plugin.
In Kodi's interface, navigate to System/Settings/Network/Services and choose "Allow control of Kodi via HTTP."

With that all in place, you'll see beets send the "update" command to your Kodi
host every time you change your beets library.
