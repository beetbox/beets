AcousticBrainz Submit Plugin
============================

The ``absubmit`` plugin lets you submit acoustic analysis results to the
`AcousticBrainz`_ server.

Installation
------------

The ``absubmit`` plugin requires the `streaming_extractor_music`_ program to run. Its source can be found on `GitHub`_, and while it is possible to compile the extractor from source, AcousticBrainz would prefer if you used their binary (see the AcousticBrainz `FAQ`_).

The ``absubmit`` plugin also requires `requests`_, which you can install using `pip`_ by typing::

    pip install requests

After installing both the extractor binary and requests you can enable the plugin ``absubmit`` in your configuration (see :ref:`using-plugins`).

Submitting Data
---------------

Type::

    beet absubmit [QUERY]

to run the analysis program and upload its results.

The plugin works on music with a MusicBrainz track ID attached. The plugin
will also skip music that the analysis tool doesn't support.
`streaming_extractor_music`_ currently supports files with the extensions
``mp3``, ``ogg``, ``oga``, ``flac``, ``mp4``, ``m4a``, ``m4r``, ``m4b``,
``m4p``, ``aac``, ``wma``, ``asf``, ``mpc``, ``wv``, ``spx``, ``tta``,
``3g2``, ``aif``, ``aiff`` and ``ape``.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, make a ``absubmit:`` section in your configuration file. The available options are:

- **auto**: Analyze every file on import. Otherwise, you need to use the ``beet absubmit`` command explicitly.
  Default: ``no``
- **extractor**: The absolute path to the `streaming_extractor_music`_ binary.
  Default: search for the program in your ``$PATH``
