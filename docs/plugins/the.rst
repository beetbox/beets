The Plugin
==========

The ``the`` plugin allows you to move patterns in path formats. It's suitable,
for example, for moving articles from string start to the end. This is useful 
for quick search on filesystems and generally looks good. Plugin DOES NOT 
change tags. By default plugin supports English "the, a, an", but custom 
regexp patterns can be added by user. How it works::

    The Something -> Something, The
    A Band -> Band, A
    An Orchestra -> Orchestra, An

To use plugin, enable it by including ``the`` into ``plugins`` line of
your beets config::

    [beets]
    plugins = the

Plugin provides template function %the, so you can use it on $albumartist or $artist::

    [paths]
    default: %the{$albumartist}/($year) $album/$track $title

Default options are acceptable (moves all English articles to the end), but you
can add plugin section into config file::

    [the]
    # handle The, default is on
    the=yes
    # handle A/An, default is on
    a=yes
    # format string, {0} - part w/o article, {1} - article
    # spaces already trimmed from ends of both parts
    # default is '{0}, {1}'
    format={0}, {1}
    # strip instead of moving to the end, default is off
    strip=no
    # do not print warnings, default is off
    silent=no
    # custom regexp patterns, separated by space
    patterns=

Custom patterns are usual regular expressions. Ignore case is turned on, but ^ is not added 
automatically, so be careful. Actually, you can swap arguments in format option and write
regexp to match end of the string, so things will be moved from the end of the string to 
start.
