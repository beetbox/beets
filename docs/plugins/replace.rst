Replace Plugin
==============

The ``replace`` plugin provides a command that replaces the audio file
of a track, while keeping the name and tags intact. It should save
some time when you get the wrong version of a song.

Enable the ``replace`` plugin in your configuration (see :ref:`using-plugins`)
and then type::

    $ beet replace <query> <path>

The plugin will show you a list of files for you to pick from, and then
ask for confirmation.

Consider using the `replaygain` command from the
:doc:`/plugins/replaygain` plugin, if you usually use it during imports.
