ImportAdded Plugin
==================

The ``importadded`` plugin is useful when an existing collection is imported
and the time when albums and items were added should be preserved.

To use the ``importadded`` plugin, enable it in your configuration (see
:ref:`using-plugins`).

Usage
-----

The :abbr:`mtime (modification time)` of files that are imported into the
library are assumed to represent the time when the items were originally
added.

The ``item.added`` field is populated as follows:

* For singleton items with no album, ``item.added`` is set to the item's file
  mtime before it was imported.
* For items that are part of an album, ``album.added`` and ``item.added`` are
  set to the oldest mtime of the files in the album before they were imported.
  The mtime of album directories is ignored.

This plugin can optionally be configured to also preserve mtimes using the
``preserve_mtimes`` option.

File modification times are preserved as follows:

* For all items:

  * ``item.mtime`` is set to the mtime of the file
    from which the item is imported from.
  * The mtime of the file ``item.path`` is set to ``item.mtime``.

Note that there is no ``album.mtime`` field in the database and that the mtime
of album directories on disk aren't preserved.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, make an ``importadded:`` section in your
configuration file. There is one option available:

- **preserve_mtimes**: After writing files, re-set their mtimes to their
  original value.
  Default: ``no``.

Reimport
--------

This plugin will skip reimported singleton items and reimported albums and all
of their items.
