LastGenre Plugin
================

The MusicBrainz database `does not contain genre information`_. Therefore, when
importing and autotagging music, beets does not assign a genre.  The
``lastgenre`` plugin fetches *tags* from `Last.fm`_ and assigns them as genres
to your albums and items.

Installation
------------

The plugin requires `pylast`_, which you can install using `pip`_ by typing::

    pip install pylast

After you have pylast installed, nable the plugin in your configuration (see
:ref:`using-plugins`).

Usage
-----

The plugin chooses genres based on a *whitelist*, meaning that only certain
tags can be considered genres. This way, tags like "my favorite music" or "seen
live" won't be considered genres. The plugin ships with a fairly extensive
`internal whitelist`_, but you can set your own in the config file using the
``whitelist`` configuration value or go for no whitelist altogether by setting
the option to `false`.

The genre list file should contain one genre per line. Blank lines are ignored.
For the curious, the default genre list is generated by a `script that scrapes
Wikipedia`_.

Canonicalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The plugin can also *canonicalize* genres, meaning that more obscure genres can
be turned into coarser-grained ones that are present in the whitelist. This
works using a tree of nested genre names, represented using `YAML`_, where the
leaves of the tree represent the most specific genres.

Genre Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When looking up genres for albums or individual tracks, you can choose whether
to use Last.fm tags on the album, the artist, or the track. For example, you
might want all the albums for a certain artist to carry the same genre.
The default is "album". When set to "track", the plugin will fetch *both*
album-level and track-level genres for your music when importing albums.


Multiple Genres
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the plugin chooses the most popular tag on Last.fm as a genre. If
you prefer to use a *list* of popular genre tags, you can increase the number
of the ``count`` config option.

Lists of up to *count* genres will then be used instead of single genres. The
genres are separated by commas by default, but you can change this with the
``separator`` config option.

`Last.fm`_ provides a popularity factor, a.k.a. *weight*, for each tag ranging
from 100 for the most popular tag down to 0 for the least popular.
The plugin uses this weight to discard unpopular tags.  The default is to
ignore tags with a weight less then 10. You can change this by setting
the ``min_weight`` config option.

Configuration
-------------

Available options:

- ``auto``: set it to ``no`` to disable automatic genre fetching during import.
  Default: ``yes``.
- ``canonical``: setting this value to ``true`` will use a built-in canonicalization
  tree. You can also set it to a path, just like the ``whitelist`` config value,
  to use your own tree. Default: ``no``
- ``count``: number of genres to fetch. Default: ``1``
- ``fallback``: by default, the file will be left unchanged when no genre is
  found. Specify a string if you prefer to use a fallback genre. You can use the
  empty string ``''` to reset the genre. Default: ``None``
- ``force``: by default, beets will always fetch new genres, even if the files already have
  once. To instead leave genres in place in when they pass the whitelist, set
  the ``force`` option to ``no``. Default: ``yes``
- ``min_weight``: minimum popularity factor below which genres are discarded.
  Default: ``10``
- ``source``: defines on which entity to perform Last.fm tags lookup. Can be
  either ``artist``, ``album`` or ``track``. Default: ``album``
- ``separator``: genres separator string
  Default: ``u', '``
- ``whitelist``: give it a custom genre list filepath or set it to 'yes' to use
  internal whitelist. If set to 'no' then all genres are considered valids.
  Default: ``yes``

Running Manually
----------------

In addition to running automatically on import, the plugin can also be run manually
from the command line. Use the command ``beet lastgenre [QUERY]`` to fetch
genres for albums matching a certain query.

To disable automatic genre fetching on import, set the ``auto`` config option
to false.
