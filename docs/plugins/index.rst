Plugins
=======

Plugins extend beets' core functionality. They add new commands, fetch
additional data during import, provide new metadata sources, and much more. If
beets by itself doesn't do what you want it to, you may just need to enable a
plugin---or, if you want to do something new, :doc:`writing a plugin
</dev/plugins>` is easy if you know a little Python.

Using Plugins
-------------

To use one of the plugins included with beets (see the rest of this page for a
list), just use the `plugins` option in your :doc:`config.yaml </reference/config>`: file, like so::

    plugins: inline convert web

The value for `plugins` can be a space-separated list of plugin names or a
YAML list like ``[foo, bar]``. You can see which plugins are currently enabled
by typing ``beet version``.

Each plugin has its own set of options that can be defined in a section bearing its name::

    plugins: inline convert web

    convert:
        auto: true

Other Plugins
-------------

In addition to the plugins that come with beets, there are several plugins
that are maintained by the beets community. To use an external plugin, there
are two options for installation:

* Make sure it's in the Python path (known as `sys.path` to developers). This
  just means the plugin has to be installed on your system (e.g., with a
  `setup.py` script or a command like `pip` or `easy_install`).

* Set the `pluginpath` config variable to point to the directory containing the
  plugin. (See :doc:`/reference/config`.)

Once the plugin is installed, enable it by placing its name on the `plugins`
line in your config file.

Here are a few of the plugins written by the beets community:

* `beetFs`_ is a FUSE filesystem for browsing the music in your beets library.
  (Might be out of date.)

* `A cmus plugin`_ integrates with the `cmus`_ console music player.

* `beets-artistcountry`_ fetches the artist's country of origin from
  MusicBrainz.

* `dsedivec`_ has two plugins: ``edit`` and ``moveall``.

* `beet-amazon`_ adds Amazon.com as a tagger data source.

* `copyartifacts`_ helps bring non-music files along during import.

* `beets-check`_ automatically checksums your files to detect corruption.

* `beets-alternatives`_ manages external files.

* `beets-follow`_ lets you check for new albums from artists you like.

* `beets-setlister`_ generate playlists from the setlists of a given artist
