Plugins
=======

Plugins extend beets' core functionality. They add new commands, fetch
additional data during import, provide new metadata sources, and much more. If
beets by itself doesn't do what you want it to, you may just need to enable a
plugin---or, if you want to do something new, :doc:`writing a plugin
</dev/plugins/index>` is easy if you know a little Python.

.. _using-plugins:

Using Plugins
-------------

To use one of the plugins included with beets (see the rest of this page for a
list), just use the ``plugins`` option in your :doc:`config.yaml
</reference/config>` file:

.. code-block:: sh

    plugins: inline convert web

The value for ``plugins`` can be a space-separated list of plugin names or a
YAML list like ``[foo, bar]``. You can see which plugins are currently enabled
by typing ``beet version``.

Each plugin has its own set of options that can be defined in a section bearing
its name:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugins: inline convert web

    convert:
        auto: true

Some plugins have special dependencies that you'll need to install. The
documentation page for each plugin will list them in the setup instructions. For
some, you can use ``pip``'s "extras" feature to install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install "beets[fetchart,lyrics,lastgenre]"

.. _metadata-source-plugin-configuration:

Using Metadata Source Plugins
-----------------------------

Some plugins provide sources for metadata in addition to MusicBrainz. These
plugins share the following configuration option:

- **source_weight**: Penalty applied to matches during import. Set to 0.0 to
  disable. Default: ``0.5``.

For example, to equally consider matches from Discogs and MusicBrainz add the
following to your configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugins: discogs

    discogs:
       source_weight: 0.0

Other Plugins
-------------

In addition to the plugins that come with beets, there are several plugins that
are maintained by the beets community. To use an external plugin, there are two
options for installation:

- Make sure it's in the Python path (known as ``sys.path`` to developers). This
  just means the plugin has to be installed on your system (e.g., with a
  ``setup.py`` script or a command like ``pip`` or ``easy_install``).
- Set the ``pluginpath`` config variable to point to the directory containing
  the plugin. (See :doc:`/reference/config`.)

Once the plugin is installed, enable it by placing its name on the ``plugins``
line in your config file.

Here are a few of the plugins written by the beets community:

beets-alternatives_
    Manages external files.

beet-amazon_
    Adds Amazon.com as a tagger data source.

beets-autogenre_
    Assigns genres to your library items using the :doc:`lastgenre <lastgenre>`

    and CLI file manipulation actions (``beet move``, etc.).

beets-originquery_
    Augments MusicBrainz queries with locally-sourced data to improve autotagger
