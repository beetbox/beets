IHate Plugin
============

The ``ihate`` plugin allows you to automatically skip things you hate during
import or warn you about them. It supports album, artist and genre patterns.
There also is a whitelist to avoid skipping bands you still like. There are two
groups: warn and skip. The skip group is checked first. Whitelist overrides any
other patterns.

To use the plugin, enable it by including ``ihate`` in the ``plugins`` line of
your beets config::

    [beets]
    plugins = ihate

You need to configure the plugin before use, so add the following section into 
your config file and adjust it to your needs::

    [ihate]
    # you will be warned about these suspicious genres/artists (regexps):
    warn_genre=rnb soul power\smetal
    warn_artist=bad\band another\sbad\sband
    warn_album=tribute\sto
    # if you don't like a genre in general, but accept some band playing it,
    # add exceptions here:
    warn_whitelist=hate\sexception
    # never import any of this:
    skip_genre=russian\srock polka
    skip_artist=manowar
    skip_album=christmas
    # but import this:
    skip_whitelist=

Note: The plugin will trust your decision in 'as-is' mode.
