synoindex Plugin
================

``synoindex`` is a very simple plugin for beets that notifies the Synology
DiskStation indexing service to index files that are imported into the beets
library.  This in turn enables new music to be immediately accessible in Audio
Station.

To use ``synoindex`` plugin, enable it in your configuration
(see :ref:`using-plugins`).
