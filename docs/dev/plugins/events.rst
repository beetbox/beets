.. _plugin_events:

Listen for Events
=================

.. currentmodule:: beets.plugins

Event handlers allow plugins to hook into whenever something happens in beets'
operations. For instance, a plugin could write a log message every time an album
is successfully autotagged or update MPD's index whenever the database is
changed.

You can "listen" for events using :py:meth:`BeetsPlugin.register_listener`.
Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from beets.plugins import BeetsPlugin


    def loaded():
        print("Plugin loaded!")


    class SomePlugin(BeetsPlugin):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.register_listener("pluginload", loaded)

Note that if you want to access an attribute of your plugin (e.g. ``config`` or
``log``) you'll have to define a method and not a function. Here is the usual
registration process in this case:

.. code-block:: python

    from beets.plugins import BeetsPlugin


    class SomePlugin(BeetsPlugin):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.register_listener("pluginload", self.loaded)

        def loaded(self):
            self._log.info("Plugin loaded!")
