For Developers
==============

This section contains information for developers. Read on if you're interested
in hacking beets itself or creating plugins for it.

See also the documentation for the MediaFile_ and Confuse_ libraries. These are
maintained by the beets team and used to read and write metadata tags and manage
configuration files, respectively.
