beets: the music geek's media organizer
=======================================

Welcome to the documentation for `beets`_, the media library management system
for obsessive-compulsive music geeks.

If you're new to beets, begin with the :doc:`guides/main` guide. That guide
walks you through installing beets, setting it up how you like it, and starting
to build your music library.

Then you can get a more detailed look at beets' features in the
:doc:`/reference/cli/` and :doc:`/reference/config` references. You might also
be interested in exploring the :ref:`included-plugins`.

If you still need help, your can drop by the ``#beets`` IRC channel on Freenode,
`email the author`_, or `file a bug`_ in the issue tracker. Please let me know
where you think this documentation can be improved.
