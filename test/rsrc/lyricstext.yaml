    Lady Madonna, children at your feet
    Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
    Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
    Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
    Friday night arrives without a suitcase
    Sunday morning creep in like a nun
    Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
    See how they run

    Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
    Wonder how you manage to feed the rest

    See how they run

    Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
    Listen to the music playing in your head

    Tuesday afternoon is never ending
    Wednesday morning papers didn't come
    Thursday night you stockings needed mending
    See how they run

    Lady Madonna, children at your feet
    Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

    It's always gone within two days.
    Follow my father, his extravagant ways.
    So if I got it I will spend it all,
    Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall.

    I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
    As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
    I love it when it says I got the means,
    To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans.

    Chorus: (x2)
    Never lasts me long,
    Handle finance wrong,
    Blow it all on bags and shoes,
    Jazz 'n blues.

    Standin' too deep at the bar today,
    Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
    Four white Russians a JD and Coke,
    Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
    But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,
    And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.
    Tell you what, my advance is comin' through,
    I'll take you out shoppin',
    Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah.

    Chorus:
    Never lasts me long,
    Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong),
    Blow it all on bags and shoes,
    Jazz 'n blues (jazz and blues).
    Never lasts me long (long),
    Handle finance wrong (wrong),
    Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all),
    Jazz 'n blues.

I_could_beat_myself: |
    oooh ahh, I'm hurting, bad
    oooh ahh I'm hurting bad!

    I did not see what I was supposed to see
    taking it easy when a friend told me I was in
    danger, so much danger.
    Underestimating my woman, not taking her
    out, working too hard and now she's gone off
    with a stranger, someone I don't even know.

    I should have taken her out, every once and a
    while, taken her to dinner on the finer side, shown
    her a life that was all worth while, now I guese I gotta
    walk an extra mile! I could beat myself! Ahh yeah.

    Now I'm gonna feel funny out there in the crowd
    when my friends all ask me, where is your woman?
    long time I don't see. Now I've got to think fast gotta
    use my head, give a good story and make sure they
    buy my version of the situation.

    All the while I wouldn't lie I'm gonna do this once
    see my reputation sinking in the distance, if they
    knew the truth that really existed...then my little sanity
    would be wasted! I could beat myself ahh yes..I could
    beat myself!!! Ohh lord lord.

    oooh ooh I'm hurting, hurting inside
    oooh ooh I'm hurting

    Now I really want to hear a little news now and
    then, this is not what I expect to hear from my
    friend I'm dissapointed. He should realize that its
    gonna destroy my position (remember I'm a name
    brand) now I've gotta see....I should have held her tight
    every once and a while, gotten it together on the finer style
    shown her a life that was all worth while, now it seems I gotta
    walk an extra mile....I could beat myself..ahh yes, I could beat myself
    ooh lord

    ooh I'm hurting
    ooooh I'm hurting,hurting inside

    I don't know what I wanna tell you
    but I wanna tell you something real, real good yes
    someting to make you
    wanna shiver

Hey_it_s_ok: |

    Cause I've found what i wanted

    Friends and lovers please forgive
    the mean things I've said
    I swear not to do again
    Please forgive the way I act when

    Hey It's OK, It's OK
    Cause I've found what i wanted
    Hey It's OK, I'ts Ok
